# Words Detection

The second step in the detection process is finding the words that make up each line. In order to find the best algorithm for this phase, we searched in literature after solutions that could be relevant to our problem. During the searches we encountered different approaches, the main ones being those approaches that we encountered when we performed a literature review to solve the problem of lines detection, which were already covered in the stage of lines detection. Following these approaches, we decided to try to develop two algorithms based on two approaches we have seen.
