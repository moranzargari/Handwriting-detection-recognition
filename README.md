# Handwriting detection & recognition
## Final project - software engineering

Despite the computer revolution in recent years, much information has been written in handwriting all over the world today as well.
Manual writing is still common among institutions, companies and organizations as well as personal needs of individuals
Such as writing summaries, drafts, notes, notes, and more.

Research on the subject of handwriting recognition has been developing in recent years, but the results are still only partial. There is a need to identify people's handwriting and convert it into computerized text in order to enable the ability to organize, organize and share the various documents, as well as to make various changes and manipulations of the text easily.
Unlike handwriting recognition of an image with printed text, which is considered relatively easy to perform, the results for handwriting recognition and recognition are only partial so far. The current best solutions to the problem are for online recognition of handwriting (recognition while writing on touch screens), but this project will deal with offline handwriting recognition,
That is, identifying the script from a scanned image containing a manuscript.
This project is an initiative of the students Itai Hefetz and Moran Zergeri and is under the direction of Dr. Yehuda Hassin. Since the project contains many complex stages, each stage of the process will be preceded by a preliminary study of each project member. After a joint analysis and reasoning, we will choose the best course of action
To realize the stage and divide the work accordingly.
The project will be divided into two main parts: discovery and identification.
The two parts are wrapped in the user interface so that an easy-to-use computer program will be created that will identify the user's handwriting from an image and convert it to typed text.
