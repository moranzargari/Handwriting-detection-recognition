# Handwriting detection & recognition
###### This program is being developed as part of 4th year final project at the software engeneering department at [Azrieli College of Engineering, jerusalem, Israel](https://english.jce.ac.il/).

Despite the computer revolution in recent years, much information has been written in handwriting all over the world today as well.
Manual writing is still common among institutions, companies and organizations as well as personal needs of individuals
Such as writing summaries, drafts, notes, notes, and more.

The research around this subject has been developing in recent years, but the results are still only partial. There is a need to detect people's handwriting and convert it into computerized text in order to enable the ability to organize and share the various documents, as well as to make various changes and manipulations of the text easily.

Unlike handwriting recognition of an image with printed text, which is considered relatively easy to perform, the results for handwriting detection and recognition are only partial so far. The current best solutions to the problem is online recognition of handwriting (recognition each letter while writing on touch screens), in this project will deal with offline handwriting recognition,
That is, identifying the words from a scanned image containing a Handwriting text.

This project is an initiative of the students Itay Hefetz and Moran Zargari and is under the direction of Dr. Yehuda Hassin. Since the project contains many complex stages, each stage of the process will be preceded by a preliminary study of each project member, After a joint analysis and drawing conclusions, we will choose the best course of action for the implementation of the stage and divide the work accordingly.

The project will be divided into two main parts: detection and recognition.
The two parts will be wrapped in a user interface, as a result we will get an easy-to-use computer program that will recognize the user's handwriting from an image and convert it to typed text.
